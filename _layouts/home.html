                        <p> The evolution of life on our planet is controlled by plate tectonics,
                          which is the surface expression of global mantle convection.
                          The Earth is a highly complex heat engine, whose heat is lost
                          through convection driven by the hot core and radioactive decay in the mantle.
                          Despite its importance, we still do not have a precise, quantitative image of
                          Earth’s interior in part because of the discrepancies between many approaches
                          used for deep Earth exploration (e.g. seismology, geodynamics, petrology);
                          In other words, we do not yet have a common ‘language’ (parameters and error bars)
                          for the various approaches to work together.  </p>

                        ‘hackathon’ week. We invite ~40 researchers,
                        to work together quantitatively to connect geodynamical
                        models to seismic data with the aid of geochemistry and petrology,
                        in order to understand the sensitivity of geodynamical scenarios on
                        seismic observables. </p>
